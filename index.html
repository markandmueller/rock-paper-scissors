        <p class="">In our UI, the player should be able to play the game by clicking on buttons rather than typing
            their answer
            in a prompt.</p>
        <p class="">For now, remove the logic that plays exactly five rounds.</p>
        <p class="done">Create three buttons, one for each selection.</p>
        <p class="done">Add an event listener to the buttons</p>
        <p class="done"> improve the event listeners on the buttons to:</p>
        <p class="done">call your playRound function with the correct playerSelection every time a button is clicked.
            (you
            can keep the console.logs for this step)</p>
        <p class="done">Add a div for displaying results</p>
        <p class=""> and change all of your console.logs into DOM methods.</p>
        <p class="">Display the running score</p>
        <p class="">and announce a winner of the game once one player reaches 5 points.</p>
        <p class="">You will likely have to refactor (rework/rewrite) your original code to make it work for this.
            That’s OK! Reworking old code is an important part of a programmer’s life.</p>
