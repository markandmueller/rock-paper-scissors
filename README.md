# rock-paper-scissors
 JavaScript project from The Odin Project to make the grade-school classic game of "rock paper scissors".


2022-11-10
Project is slow going, but I feel I have a base down possibly. But, I feel I could get further in the project and not have this base be usable.

I've gotten to the point where:
- an array generates a random choice for the Computer
- I hardcode in a selection for the Player
- I have a function that plays a round and sees the equality of both selections
- I can console.log() that the selections do not match

Next Steps:
- create if else statements for all the possible win/loss combinations and their return string alerts
- prompt for input of Players Selection
- transform Players Selection to allLowerCase
- write new function called game() that does 5 rounds
keeps score
reports a winner or loser at the end

Next Steps:
- create if else statements for all the possible win/loss combinations and their return string alerts

Pseudo code
rock wins scissors
paper wins rock
scissors wins paper

IF selections are the same == Tie
IF User selects rock and Computer selects scissors, User == Winner
IF User selects rock and Computer selects paper, User !== Winner
IF User selects paper and Computer selects rock, User == Winner
IF User selects paper and Computer selects scissors, User !== Winner
IF User selects scissors and Computer selects paper, User == Winner
IF User selects scissors and Computer selects rock, User !== Winner

2022-11-11 - END of session 1
Seem to have the correct outcome displaying for the player winning or losing.
Have player selection hard coded in for now. 
Getting correct console.log for selections.

Next to do:
- prompt for input of Players Selection
- transform Players Selection to allLowerCase
<!-- - write new function called game() that does 5 rounds
keeps score
reports a winner or loser at the end -->
