 JavaScript project from The Odin Project to make the grade-school classic game of "rock paper scissors".

Project is slow going, but I feel I have a base down possibly. But, I feel I could get further in the project and not have this base be usable.

I've gotten to the point where:
- an array generates a random choice for the Computer
- I hardcode in a selection for the Player
- I have a function that plays a round and sees the equality of both selections
- I can console.log() that the selections do not match

Next Steps:
- create if else statements for all the possible win/loss combinations and their return string alerts
- prompt for input of Players Selection
- transform Players Selection to allLowerCase
- write new function called game() that does 5 rounds
keeps score
reports a winner or loser at the end
